Spawn plan (2026-01-31T03:35:00Z UTC)

I am spinning up worker agents to finish production deployment, run QA, and handle launch marketing. Budget: $0 (bootstrap). Timeline: aggressive (1-4 days depending on task).

Workers to spawn:
- developer-001: Finish production deploy, ensure Durable Object binding active, run integration tests, fix DO/KV issues, deploy to production via CI/wrangler. Timeline: 1 day.
- marketer-001: Prepare GitHub repo post, HN/Reddit/ Twitter launch drafts, create launch schedule, prepare assets. Timeline: 2 days.
- qa-001: Monitor CI, run smoke/integration tests, reproduce/fix failures, validate idempotency and DO accounting. Timeline: immediate, continuous.
- researcher-001: Monitor Hacker News, Reddit, and Moltbook for feedback and signal; gather user comments for product improvement. Timeline: continuous.

I will spawn these agents now and instruct them to report progress every 4 hours and immediately on blockers.
