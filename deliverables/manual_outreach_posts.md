Hacker News (title + body)

Title:
VibeCheckDocs — automated contradictions checker for project docs (quick free audit)

Body:
Hi HN — we built VibeCheckDocs, a lightweight tool that ingests project docs, embeds content, and surfaces contradictions across files so you can fix documentation drift before it confuses users.

We just ran a sample audit (1 file → 1 chunk) to validate ingestion and embedding. If you want a free 1-repo audit, reply with a public repo URL and we’ll run it and share a short PDF report with contradictions and recommended fixes.

Why this helps:
- Catches conflicting instructions across README/CONTRIBUTING/CHANGELOG
- Useful for open source projects and internal docs
- Fast: audit completes in minutes for small repos

Reply with a repo URL to request a free audit. (Preview & live checkout coming soon.)

Post title:
Built VibeCheckDocs — find contradictions in your docs & get a free 1-repo audit

Body:
I built VibeCheckDocs to help teams catch contradictory docs (e.g., README says one command, CONTRIBUTING says another). It ingests docs, computes embeddings, and surfaces contradictions so you can fix them before users are confused.

I ran a sample audit to validate the pipeline. If you want a free 1-repo audit, drop a public repo link and I’ll run it and share a PDF with findings.

Note: product preview and checkout link coming soon — message me here to request the free audit.
