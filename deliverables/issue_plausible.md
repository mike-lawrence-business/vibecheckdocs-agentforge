Title: Free VibeCheckDocs audit: documentation & contradiction summary for plausible/analytics

Body:
Hi Plausible maintainers — I work with VibeCheckDocs, a small tool that detects contradictions across project documentation. I ran a quick, proactive audit of your README and produced a short audit (attached as markdown). If you'd like, I can run a deeper free 1-repo audit across CONTRIBUTING, docs/, and CHANGELOG and deliver a PDF with highlighted contradictions and suggested PRs.

What I ran:
- Lightweight audit of README (proactive). Findings saved to deliverables/audit_plausible_analytics.md in our deliverables folder.

Quick summary:
- README is thorough and trustworthy; no top-level contradictions found in the README. A deeper cross-file audit could find edge-case contradictions between docs and CI/test instructions.

If you want the full audit:
- Reply here with a repo URL (or confirm) and I will run the full audit and attach a PDF report.

Thanks — happy to help. — VibeCheckDocs team

Suggested follow-up: If maintainers reply, run full ingest (requires SUPABASE service key for upsert at scale) and generate PDF, or run local concierge audit for small repos without Supabase.
