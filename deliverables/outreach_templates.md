**Subject:** Free Concierge Docs Audit for [Project Name]

Hi [Maintainer Name],

We built **[VibeCheckDocs](https://web-eta-six-74.vercel.app)** to stop "docs rot" — it detects semantic contradictions between your code, config, and documentation (e.g., docs say "returns JSON" but code outputs text).

We're offering a **free 1-2 hour concierge audit** for **[Project Name]**. We'll run our scanner against your repo and manually verify the findings.

**What you get:**
1.  A prioritized report of inconsistencies.
2.  A "Fix PR" ready to merge (we fix the low-hanging fruit for you).
3.  Zero friction — no signup required for this pilot.

**Why?** We're validating our scanning engine and looking for pilot feedback. No strings attached.

**Interested?**
Reply here or claim your audit directly at: **https://web-eta-six-74.vercel.app**

Best,
The VibeCheckDocs Team

**Body:**
Hey everyone,

We just launched **VibeCheckDocs**: https://web-eta-six-74.vercel.app

It scans your codebase and documentation to find **semantic contradictions**.
*   *Docs:* "The default port is 8080."
*   *Config:* `DEFAULT_PORT = 3000`
*   *VibeCheck:* **Contradiction found.**

We're currently running **free concierge audits** for open source projects to train our model. If you want us to scan your repo and send you a report + fix PR, drop a comment or check out the site.
